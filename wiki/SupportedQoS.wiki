== Packet scheduling ==

Algorithms to determine the order in which packets are to be send.

  * FIFO
  * Priority Queing
  * Round robin 
  * Weighted round robin
  * WeightedFairQueing (WFQ)
  * Class-Based WFQ

== Packet classification & marking ==

Algoritms to determine packet priority (and thus its output queue).

  * Best efford (no QoS)
